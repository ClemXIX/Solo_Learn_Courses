Remainder


We need to distribute math and history textbooks to students.
There are 2 class sections: the first section has 18 pupils, and the second one has 19. The total number of books available for distribution is 76.
Write a program to calculate and output how many books will be left after each student receives both books.
Use the modulo operator (%) to get the remainder.
