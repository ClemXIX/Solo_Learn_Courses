Youâ€™re analyzing a data set and need to remove the outliers (the smallest and largest values.
The data is stored in a list).

Complete the code to remove the smallest and largest elements from the list and output the sum of the remaining numbers.
Remember the functions a list supports: min and max can be used to get the smallest and largest numbers.
