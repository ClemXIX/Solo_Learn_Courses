<h1> First program</h1>
<!--Your First Program

Write a program to print "JS is fun".
Note that the sentence starts with capital letters.

Hint
Use console.log() function.
Remember to enclose the text into double quotes.-->

<script>
<!-- No need of the <script> cause sololearn run on node.js-->
  console.log('JS is fun')
</script>




<h1>Comments</h1>

<!--Comments

The program you’re given outputs a list of names to the console.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to change the code
to output only the items with even numbers. -->


<script>
//console.log("1. James")
console.log("2. John")
//console.log("3. Amy")
console.log("4. Collin")
//console.log("5. Tom")
console.log("6. Lisa")
</script>





<h1>Escaping Characters in Strings</h1>

<!-- Strings are enclosed in double or single quotes.

But what if we want to include double quotes in double quoted strings,
 or single quotes in single quoted strings? We need to escape!

Grab your lockpicks, and fix the code you’re given to generate the correct output.
Remember, you need to escape the quotes in the strings to fix the errors in the code.-->

<script>
    console.log('I\'m learning JavaScript');
    console.log("A quote: \"Java is to JavaScript as ham is to hamster.\" ");
</script>
</body>
